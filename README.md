A rich and powerful CSV import component for Laravel Nova. CSV Import allows you to easily upload CSV or Excel files
and import their data into any Nova resource.

**No need to make your file match your database!** The import process lets you choose how to map the relevant columns
from your uploaded file to the attributes on your models, with a nice summary at the end of what worked and what didn't.

You can even modify values as they're being imported to add hashing or other manipulations, set custom values, random
values and now even **combine multiple values to be imported into a single field**!

> This package was originally built on top of work done by Sparclex on the
> [nova-import-card](https://github.com/Sparclex/nova-import-card) package.

**NB: As of v0.4.0, CSV Import requires Nova v4 and above. For Nova versions prior to v4, please use a CSV Import
v0.3.0 or lower. Please also be aware that versions prior to v0.4.0 will no longer be maintained.**

## Sponsorship

CSV Import is completely free to use for personal or commercial use, however if you're using it for commercial gain
I'd really appreciate your support! I accept [donations via GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/simonhamp).

Thank you 🙏

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require simonhamp/laravel-nova-csv-import --with-all-dependencies
```

Once installed, you must register the component in your app's `NovaServiceProvider`
(usually in `app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php`):

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use SimonHamp\LaravelNovaCsvImport\LaravelNovaCsvImport;

class NovaServiceProvider extends NovaApplicationServiceProvider
{
    public function tools()
    {
        return [
            new LaravelNovaCsvImport,
        ];
    }
}
```

### If you have customised your Nova main menu

If you have [customised your main menu](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/4.0/customization/menus.html#customizing-the-main-menu),
then you will need to manually register the tool's menu item in your custom menu for it to appear.

For example, in your `app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php`:

```php
public function boot()
{
    parent::boot();

    Nova::mainMenu(function (Request $request) {
        return [
            // ... other custom menu items

            MenuSection::make('CSV Import')
                ->path('/csv-import')
                ->icon('upload'),
        ];
    }
}
```

## Options

By default, _all_ of your Nova Resources will be available for import. However, there are a number of ways that you can
explicitly limit what's available for importing.

`public static $canImportResource = false;`  
_Default:_ `true`  
Add this static property to your Resource to prevent it from showing up in the Nova CSV Import tool interface.

`public static function canImportResource($request): bool`  
Define a `canImportResource` method to use more complex logic to decide if this Resource can be shown during import.
If defined, this takes precedence over the `$canImportResource` property.

### Exclude certain fields

CSV Import aims to respect your Nova configuration, but there are times when you want your imports to behave slightly
differently to your Nova interface. For that you can use the `excludeAttributesFromImport()` method:

`public static function excludeAttributesFromImport(): array`  
_Default:_ `[]`  
Define a `excludeAttributesFromImport` method that returns an array of attribute names that you want to _exclude_ from
being visible in the import tool for this Resource.

### Example

```php
// App\Nova\User
public static function canImportResource(Request $request)
{
    return $request->user()->can("create", self::$model);
}

public static function excludeAttributesFromImport()
{
    return ['password'];
}
```

## Importer Class

This package uses [maatwebsite/excel](https://github.com/Maatwebsite/Laravel-Excel) behind the scenes to handle the
actual import. You can find out more about
[how importing works](https://docs.laravel-excel.com/3.1/imports/basics.html#importing-basics).

You can define your own importer class by providing the relevant class name in your published copy of this package's
config file.

First, publish the config file:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=csv-import
```

Then, define and register your own importer class:

```
<?php

return [
    'importer' =>  App\Utilities\Importer::class,
];
```

## Usage

CSV Import is a powerful tool, but I'm trying to make it simple and easy to use for anyone. For tips and tricks
